Chris serves as the Vice President of Operations for Nuvectra Medical, an active implantable medical device company committed to improving the lives of people with chronic conditions. Chris is one of the original members of the Nuvectra commercialization team. He played a lead role in developing and executing the operational infrastructure, including, supply chain, warehousing and distribution, IT, compliance, and a point-of-sale solution. Â It is this infrastructure that provides the foundation from which Nuvectra currently operates and will continue to leverage as Nuvectra continues its hyper-growth and launches new therapies. He was also instrumental in spinning-off Nuvectra from its parent company in 2016 into a independent publicly traded corporation by securing long-term supply chain agreements and establishing independent warehousing and worldwide distribution.

Prior to joining Nuvectra, Chris lead the Health Policy, Preauthorization and Reimbursement teams at Abbott. These teams were instrumental in Congressional discussions with regard to healthcare reform and repeal of the medical device tax. They also achieved insurance approvals on behalf of tens of thousands of patients who would not otherwise have had access to Abbott therapies. 

Chris began his career in medical devices 15 years ago as the Vice President of Strategy for a startup neuromodulation therapy where, in partnership with the CEO and COO wrote the business plan and secured $13MM in angel funding. Once funding was secured he turned his attention to company infrastructure including, compliance, IT, manufacturing, distribution, reimbursement and supply chain.

Chris holds an MBA from Southern Methodist University as well as Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from Clemson University.
