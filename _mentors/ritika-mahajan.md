Ritika joined Radian Capital in 2017 where she focuses on growth equity investing in the healthcare and technology verticals. She is excited about back-office and workflow solutions that make health systems and payers more effective and efficient, especially as it relates to increased pressure to manage margins in a value-based care environment.

 

Prior to joining Radian, she focused on enterprise technology investments at Advent International (including HCIT) and did strategy consulting at McKinsey & Co. Ritika received her MBA from Harvard Business School and her B.B.A from the University of Michigan.
