While spending 10 years in the automotive industry, Richard helped his wife launch her handbag and apparel company Ashard Richley and founded a company to successfully take a mobile app called Charade Date to market.

 

He left his day job in early 2015 to found OMMDOM, Inc. / CancerGene Connect which was acquired by Invitae (NVTA) in June of 2017.

 

Richard has broad general knowledge in sales, management, and software development and extensive knowledge in selling software into the healthcare space. He hopes to add value by sharing what was learned in taking a small startup through to successful acquisition.
