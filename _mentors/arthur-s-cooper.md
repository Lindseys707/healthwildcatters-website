President, Managing Partner and Board Member, THMED

Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Fidelis Partners, Allied Staffing Network and THMED Executive Search

As Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Fidelis Partners, THMED Executive Search, and Allied Staffing Network, Arthur Cooper has developed a reputation as a results-driven leader in the healthcare recruitment industry. He also currently serves as President, Managing Partners and Board Member at the parent company of THMED, LLC.

With nearly two decades of experience in the staffing industry, Mr. Cooper has parlayed his background to become a driving force in healthcare recruitment and propelled the THMED companies to become healthcare industry leaders. His dedication and leadership led to the startup achieving over $30 million in sales and employing over 150 workers after only six years. In 2016, THMED was recognized for its 124 percent revenue growth in three years in Inc. Magazine’s 5000 Fastest Growing Private Companies and as one of the Best Places to Work in North Texas by the Dallas Business Journal.

Despite his executive position, Mr. Cooper believes in remaining active in the daily business operations of THMED companies. He’s as equally interested in achieving and refining THMED’s overall vision and company culture as he is in recruiting and mentoring new talent. He also focuses on consistently building new relationships with clients and potential partners.

Mr. Cooper has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to serving his community. As a Marine, he served in both Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He also earned two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals during his four years of service. Mr. Cooper also maintains an active membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and volunteers as Elders Quorum President. Now, that same sense of obligation to the wider community has led him to become a mentor with the Health Wildcatters, so he can provide his expertise to fledgling startups in the health industry.

Recognized for his business acumen, emotional intelligence, and personal integrity, Mr. Cooper has spoken at the American College of Healthcare Executives leadership event, an annual conference for staff physician recruiters and a recruitment board for a hospital system. He also served on the Physician Advisory Board for Excela Health Medical Group Advisory Board from 2012 through 2014.

Prior to his time at THMED, LLC, he was recognized as a top sales producer for eight consecutive years as an Executive Vice President at a competing firm. Mr. Cooper also exceeded the sales goals during his tenure by nearly 300 percent and by doing so accounted for 40% of the entire revenue of his previous employer.

Mr. Cooper resides in Lucas, TX with his wife of almost two decades and their four children. Outside of work, Mr. Cooper enjoys playing golf, coaching his children’s sports teams, and spending time with his family.
