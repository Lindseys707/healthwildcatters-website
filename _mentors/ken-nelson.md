Ken Nelson’s successful Sales, Marketing, and Business Development leadership experience ranges from start-ups with disruptive technologies (iRhythm Technologies: NASDAQ Ticker = IRTC and Reachview Technologies: acquired by Alcatel-Lucent Technologies) to the Fortune 500 (Boston Scientific – Cardiac Rhythm Management; NYSE Ticker = BSX).  Most recently, his leadership experience includes leading Medical Device, Diagnostic Services, and Digital Health industry sales and strategic partnership activity, as well as domestic and international business development and M&A activity, for BioTelemetry (formerly CardioNet; NASDAQ Ticker = BEAT).  BioTelemetry is the leading publicly traded wireless medical technology company in Digital Health, with an initial focus on cardiac monitoring devices and services, and annual revenue of $200 Million+.

 

Over the past 5 years, he has been the U.S. VP of Sales and Business Development for BioTelemetry (formerly CardioNet), with a team of 8 Sales Directors and 100+ Sales Reps that had experienced 3 consecutive years of declining sales and 40%+ sales team turnover at the time he started, and he coached, developed, and motivated that team to drive and achieve the following significant accomplishments:

 

* _19 consecutive quarters of year over year revenue growth (4 consecutive years of revenue and share growth)_ 
* _Annual revenue growth from $111.5M in 2012 to $208.3M in 2016_
* _14.8% revenue growth in 2016 over 2015_
* _Annual patient volume growth from 260,000 patients in 2012 to over 600,000 patients in 2016_
* _11 consecutive quarters of sequential EBITDA and profitability expansion_ 
* _4.8% sales team turnover in 2016_
* _Stock price growth from $2 per share when I started in 2012 to $35+ per share in 2017_
* _Acquisitions of Biomedical Systems’ cardiac monitoring division, DELTA’s ePatch division, and R&D strategic partnership with the Belgium based nano-electronics research center IMEC, along with Denmark based DELTA to co-develop multiple revolutionary mHealth and cardiac monitoring patch products_

 

Prior to BioTelemetry, Ken was national Vice President of Sales and Marketing for iRhythm Technologies, a start-up cardiac monitoring company funded by St. Jude Medical, and which went public in Q4 2016 (market cap currently $1 Billion+; NASDAQ symbol = IRTC).   In this role he built the entire foundational sales and marketing team for the U.S., developed the launch strategy for Zio Patch, a revolutionary new cardiac monitoring patch, growing sales from less than 2,500 devices in 2010 to over 30,000 in 2011, eventually leading to an IPO in 2016.   

 

Prior to joining iRhythm, Ken spent 8 years at Boston Scientific (formerly Guidant) in their Cardiac Rhythm Management Division (implantable pacemakers and defibrillators) gaining progressive medical device sales leadership experience.  While at Boston Scientific, Ken held a number of positions including Regional Sales Manager, Area Business Manager, National Accounts Associate, Field Clinical Sales Representative, and Senior Sales and Pricing Analyst.   Before transitioning into medical device sales, Ken started his career in Corporate Finance, where he worked for 2 Fortune 100 Companies, AOL-Time Warner and Allstate Insurance.

 

Ken earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Vanderbilt University and resides in Dallas, Texas with his wife Jami and 3 children, Campbell, Charlie, and Kate.
