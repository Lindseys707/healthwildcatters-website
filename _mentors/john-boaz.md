Mr. Boaz founded McKinney Assisted Living in 1998 and Reliant Home Health in 2004.  He currently serves as Chairman and CEO of both companies while maintaining an active role in the Dallas startup community.  He is a board member of the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), Allen Foundation, and most recently accepted a board position at Helping Restore Ability (non-profit serving low income seniors).

Mr. Boaz has provided seed capital and participated in an advisory role for many local startups.  His most recent project is Legacy Builder, an online tool to digitize your life in a private family oriented community, which will have its public launch in May of 2013.  Mr. Boaz has also served on the board of the Collin County Committee on Aging and has given in excess of $200 thousand to fund the local meals on wheels program throughout Collin County.  He has a great passion for our aging population and has spent the past 15 years working on ways to improve the lives of all around him.

Mr. Boaz believes that people vastly underestimate their ability to cause disruptive change in today’s healthcare space.  He believes that good people with good coaching will produce great results and that the Healthcare Wildcatters is a proven model to accelerate these innovative ideas.
