#### Adam Cohen is a serial entrepreneur and inventor holding over 70 issued U.S. utility patents with some 20 pending, including seven different 3D printing and robotics technologies. Adam has 27 years of technology startup and senior management experience spanning advanced manufacturing, robotics/automation, and medical devices, both as a technical innovator and through business development and marketing of breakthrough technologies. He is a pioneer of the 3D printing industry, having brought to market three different 3D printing processes including the first commercial 3D printer, and invented several others processes.

#### Adam is Founder and CEO of Now Cuisine, Inc., a food tech startup, and of innoNovo LLC, a consultancy focused on 3D printing, robotics, and product development.

#### He founded Microfabrica Inc. to commercialize a revolutionary 3D printing technology he invented that enables mass production of highly-miniaturized metal devices. As the company’s CEO, he raised $17M in venture funding from investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Chevron. He later led Microfabrica’s successful entry into the medical device business, landing major customers and serving as co-PI with Harvard and Boston University on a $5M NIH project to develop robotic devices for minimally-invasive cardiac surgery. This led to a major equity investment by Versant Ventures and InterWest Partners.

#### Prior to Microfabrica, Adam co-founded and served as Vice President of AMEX-traded Soligen Technologies, the first company to license and commercialize MIT’s 3D Printing technology. Earlier, Adam launched and edited the first periodical of the 3D printing industry. As Program/Product Line Manager at 3D Systems, he led the team that brought to market the world’s first 3D printing system, a product that generated over $100M in revenue for the company.

#### As an SMU professor and founder and director of the Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing, Robotics, and Automation, Adam pursued research on robotic systems and next-generation 3D printing processes sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative and private sources. His activities included developing a novel class of robot for minimally-invasive procedures; filing ten U.S. utility patent applications; and teaching design, robotics, mechanical engineering, and prototyping.

#### Adam received a bachelor’s degree in physics from MIT.
